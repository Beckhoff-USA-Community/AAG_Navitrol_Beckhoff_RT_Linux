(*
1 - Front wheel steer
Only for omni drives. Moves the navigation point to between the front wheels. With this steer type almost all turning control will be done by the rear wheels.
2 - Mid wheel steer
	Normal driving. The normal navigation point is used.
3 - Rear wheel steer
	Only for omni drives. Moves the navigation point to between the rear wheels. With this steer type almost all turning control will be done by the front wheels.
5 - Pivot steer
	Pivot curvature is always given, and supervisor can control only the speed up to maximum of pivot_speed-parameter. This mode should only be activated, if the AGV can pivot.
6 - Parallel steer forward
	Only for omni drives.
	The curvature in this mode is always zero. Instead of curvature supervisor controls the frame heading instead and speed. Wheels will rotate forward with positive speed reference.
7 - Parallel steer backward
	Only for omni drives.
	The curvature in this mode is always zero. Instead of curvature supervisor controls the frame heading instead and speed. Wheels will rotate backwards with positive speed reference.
