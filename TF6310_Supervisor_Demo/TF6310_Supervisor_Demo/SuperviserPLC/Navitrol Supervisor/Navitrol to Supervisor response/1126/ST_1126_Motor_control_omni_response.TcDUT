		Message_number		   : UDINT;
		Supervisor_status_out  : ST_1126_Supervisor_status_out;
		Driving_vector_Angle   : REAL; //Reference driving vector angle relative to the vehicle frame. (+/-PI in radians)0-forwards along vehicle center line. Positive direction is CCW from vehicle center lin
		Steering_Radius		   : REAL; //Radius to center of rotation from navigation point (m).0-pivoting around vehicle navigation point. Positive value sets the center of rotation to a direction of 90 deg CCW from the driving vector angle. For example with 0 deg driving vector angle vehicle turns to left with positive radius and to right with negative radius.
		Navigation_point_speed : REAL; //Reference speed of the vehicle navigation point along driving vector (m/s) Positive along driving vector, negative against driving vector (i.e. driving vector ± PI).
		Number_of_Wheels	   : UINT; //Number of omni wheels, maximum 6, minimum 2. Determined by parameter omni_steer_nbr
		Omni_wheels_ref_struct : ARRAY[0..1] OF ST_1126_Omni_wheels_ref_struct;//The references for each individual omni wheel
