// Header info is parsed before being copied into the correct message structure.
// PLC logic is built expecting to receive the entire TCP message payload with one call to FB_SocketReceive.
// FB_SocketReceive will fragment the received data if the receive buffer is not large enough.
// Make sure this is large enough to fit the biggest received message.
